# Order Types
add price formula 
- **Market** — executes now at best available price
- **Limit** — executes at limit price or better
- **Trigger Market** — market order that activates on trigger
- **Trigger Limit** — limit order that activates on trigger
- **Oracle** — market order with oracle-based auction pricing

## Market Orders

- Execute immediately at the best available price
- Use auction mechanism for price discovery. Default time-in-force is 60 seconds
- Best for: immediate execution when speed matters more than price

## Limit Orders

- Execute only at the specified price or better
- Rest in the order book until filled or canceled
- Can be post-only to ensure maker behavior
- Best for: price-sensitive trades where you want to avoid slippage

## Trigger Market Orders

- Market order that activates when trigger condition is met
- Uses oracle price as reference for trigger evaluation
- Executes immediately upon activation at best available price
- Best for: stop-loss scenarios where certainty of execution matters

## Trigger Limit Orders

- Limit order that activates when trigger condition is met
- Uses oracle price as reference for trigger evaluation
- After activation, behaves as a regular limit order
- Best for: take-profit scenarios where price control is important

## Oracle Orders

- Market order with oracle-based auction pricing
- Auction start/end prices derived from oracle price offsets
- Provides price discovery mechanism for large orders
- Best for: large orders where you want controlled price discovery

## Trigger Orders: Reference Price & Activation

Trigger orders use the oracle price as the reference for activation. The trigger condition evaluates whether the oracle price is above or below the specified trigger price.

- **Above** — order activates when oracle price > trigger price
- **Below** — order activates when oracle price < trigger price

After activation, the child order behaves as a Market or Limit order accordingly.

A trigger-logic update is planned but not yet live. Behavior here reflects production today and will be updated after release.

## Common Order Options

- **Reduce-Only** — only decreases an existing position
- **Post-Only** — will not cross the book; cancels/adjusts if it would take
- **Immediate-or-Cancel (IOC)** — fill what can execute now; cancel the rest
- **Take Profit (TP)** — triggered order to realize gains
- **Stop Loss (SL)** — triggered order to cap losses
- **TP/SL presets** — linked triggers sized by position percentage or fixed amount

## Notes
- **Stop Limit can miss in fast moves** — use Stop Market if certainty of exit matters more than price
- **Slippage depends on liquidity/spread/size** — larger orders may experience more slippage
- **Post-Only guarantees maker behavior** but can cancel if it would cross the book
- **Trigger orders use oracle price** — not the order book price for activation
