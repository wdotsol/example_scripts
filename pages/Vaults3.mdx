# Vault mechanics
### Trading via Delegate
The delegate wallet is authorized to trade from the vault’s Drift account. They cannot withdraw funds, only the vault program can do that.
Strategies may include perp trading, basis trades, or yield farming. Profits/losses accrue to the vault’s equity, and share price reflects these changes over time.
The manager may optionally invest their own funds. These are tracked separately and may impact fee logic.

### Liquidation / reduce only
If a large withdrawal is requested and the vault is highly leveraged, fulfilling it might breach margin requirements.

In this case:
- Liquidation Delegate:  Temporarily replaces the delegate trader. Can only reduce positions.
- Reduce-Only Mode:  Vault trades are restricted to closing positions. The liquidator aims to free collateral to fulfill withdrawals.
- Deadline:  Liquidation control lasts for up to 1 hour. After that, control reverts to the original delegate.

This system ensures that users can exit the vault without relying on the manager.

### Vault shares
- Vault Equity:  Total value of the vault’s assets.
- Shares:  Internal accounting units, not tokens. All PnL and fees flow through share accounting.
- Share Price = Vault Equity / Total Shares  Deposit/withdraw actions mint or burn shares to maintain fair value. Trading performance alters share price.
- Fees via Share Transfer:
  -   Management fee: new shares are minted to the manager, diluting other holders.
  -   Performance fee: shares are reallocated from users to the manager based on profit over watermark.
- User vs Manager Shares:  Manager shares = total - user - protocol shares. Fees are taken by reallocating shares, not by removing underlying assets directly.
- Watermark Logic:  Prevents double-charging on volatile apy. Users pay performance fees only on new highs.
