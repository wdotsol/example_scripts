## Drift Order Matching 

Order matching begins with the `fulfill_perp_order()` function, which serves as the primary entry point. This function gathers potential maker orders using `get_maker_orders_info()` and determines the best fulfillment strategy by `determine_perp_fulfillment_methods()`.

The auction price ticks per slot(400ms). At each slot, the protocol evaluates whether any available maker or AMM offer satisfies the taker's auction price.

### Sources of Liquidity

Drift's matching engine relies on three sources of liquidity:

- **JIT Liquidity**: Makers providing reactive, slot-specific quotes as response to taker orders (Hidden liquidity)
- **Resting Orders**: Orders that are resting on the orderbook, can be seen on chain
- **vAMM**: The protocol-owned automated market maker, used when other sources are unavailable

### The JIT Auction Mechanism

When a taker submits an order, it initiates a Just-In-Time (JIT) auction. This auction follows a Dutch format where the price linearly decreases (or increases depending on direction) from a user-defined start price to an end price over a specified number of slots. Makers can observe this auction and may choose to provide liquidity at any time during the auction window. Fill execution is fcfs among offers.

If the taker’s order is not filled during the JIT auction phase, meaning neither JIT nor DLOB liquidity is sufficient, the protocol can also fall back on the vAMM(after 10 slots).

### Auction Parameters

Each taker order includes specific parameters that define the auction behavior:

- **Auction duration**: Total number of slots the auction runs
- **Start and end price**: The bounds of the Dutch auction
- **Limit price**: Maximum or minimum acceptable price after the auction
- **Max timestamp**: Expiration time of the order

These parameters define a linear price curve over the auction duration

Prices may be expressed as static values or as relative offsets from oracle prices, allowing the user/order to adapt to market volatility in real time.

### Order Types and Behavior

**Market orders** must have an auction and expiration timestamp. These are designed to be executed quickly and proceed through JIT and potentially AMM liquidity.

**Limit orders** may optionally include auction parameters. During the auction phase, they can only take liquidity. Afterward, they become resting orders that may provide liquidity. Limit orders can also be flagged as post-only.

### Fill Mechanisms

Taker orders may be filled in one of the following ways:

- **Keeper-facilitated fills**: Keeper bots submit transactions that match orders against resting liquidity
- **Self-fills**: Users submit transactions to fill their own orders
- **JIT fills**: Makers submit transactions that match orders during the JIT auction window

### DLOB vs. JIT Competition

DLOB orders represent pre-existing, resting liquidity. JIT makers, can submit new maker orders after seeing the taker's order. JIT makers benefit from a same-slot advantage: they are allowed to match within the same slot as the taker order, while DLOB makers typically cannot, due to rules preventing self-trading. This difference explains why a high proportion of fills are from JIT participants.

However, both DLOB and JIT orders are subject to price validation. A valid race only occurs if both parties offer prices that satisfy the current slot’s auction price. Thus, both speed and price competitiveness are required.

### The Role of the vAMM

The vAMM serves as a backstop, activating when no DLOB or JIT orders are available/sufficient. It quotes prices centered around the oracle price and sticks to defined parameters. 
It is incentivized through fee rebates and does not distribute profits to insurance funds but reinvests them into market liquidity. The vAMM will not provide liquidity if the oracle is invalid/stale. Its quoting behavior updates before every potential fill and can be limited by inventory and protocol thresholds.

In some cases, the vAMM also participates in JIT fills to rebalance risk exposure, for example when external makers decline to fill undesirable flow. This ensures continued solvency and smooth markets.
