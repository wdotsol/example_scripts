# Referral Links

Create your own referral link today, and boost your earnings when you refer new users to trade on Drift! For every new user, you will earn a portion of their trading fees!

- Referrers earn **35%** of the fees from users they refer.
- Referred users receive a **5%** discount on their trading fees.

This document will walk you through setting up your referral link to begin earning today.

### A few notes:

- There is **no max cap** to the amount of receivable rewards!
- Rewards for the referrer accrue only from taker volume.
- Referring users that reach **tier 3 and above** (>10m monthly volume) will not generate any referrer rewards or referree discount. 

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
The referral link applies solely to *new* Drift accounts created through your link. For it to apply, users must have clicked the link, connected their wallet, and made a deposit within the same session.
