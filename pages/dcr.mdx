# Drift Collateral Rewards

At Drift, we're exploring a new approach to incentives. 

Starting with syrupUSDC, we directly incentivize **traders who open perp positions using their deposited collateral**.  
This ensures rewards are tied to both providing liquidity and taking active trading positions.

## SyrupUSDC

SyrupUSDC, the liquid yield-generating stablecoin from Maple Finance, is now supported as collateral on Drift.  
To celebrate the listing, we're launching a **$100,000 incentives program** for traders who use syrupUSDC as collateral to open positions.

- **Total rewards:** $100,000 USDC  
- **Week 1 distribution:** $12,500 USDC

## How Rewards Work

**Deposit syrupUSDC as collateral** for an active perpetual position to start earning rewards.

- Incentives accrue continuously and are distributed among participants who meet **both** criteria:
  1. Have syrupUSDC deposited as collateral.
  2. Maintain an active perpetual position.

Your share of rewards is based on:

```
min(deposited syrupUSDC, open perp notional)
```

This means rewards are aligned with both your syrupUSDC balance and your trading activity.

## Maximizing Rewards

To earn the most from incentives:

- Keep your **open interest (OI)** in perpetuals **higher** than your deposited syrupUSDC balance.
- Maintain active positions during the reward cycle to maximize accrual.
- Monitor your collateral and notional exposure to avoid being capped by the `min()` rule above.
