## Overview

Drift’s Builder Code (DBC) system enables any builder to build on top of Drift **while earning fees** for routing trades.

Drift Builder Codes establish the financial infrastructure layer on Solana, by allowing anyone tap into Drift’s deep liquidity and efficient execution, without building their own backend. This enables a fully open, composable UI layer for perps and spot on Solana.

This Builder Code system makes Drift the first on-chain DEX on Solana to offer **per order monetization** for third-party frontends, setting the stage for a permissionless ecosystem of apps, bots, and aggregators all aligned with Drift and Solana’s liquidity growth. 

### Getting started with DBC

- **Builder Registration:**
In order to receive fees, builders are required to have an existing Drift account. 

- **User Onboarding:**  
Before placing any orders, users must approve the builder and the maximum allowed builder fee.  
This creates or updates the user's `ApprovedBuildersMap` account.

### How Builder Codes Work

1. **Order Placement**  
   The builder’s app constructs a `place_order` transaction, specifying the builder’s public key and fee (up to the user-approved max).  
   The user’s `ApprovedBuildersMap` and `RevenueShareEscrow` are included for program verification.

2. **Fee Accrual (Per Order)**  
   When an order is filled, the builder’s fee is credited per-order into the user’s `RevenueShareEscrow` account. Funds accumulate here until settlement.

3. **Settlement**  
   When the user calls `SettlePnl`, all pending builder rewards are swept from their escrow to the respective builder’s `RevenueShare` account(s).  
   Builders/referrers then move these rewards into their Drift account positions with `settle_revenue_share`.

### Notes on builder codes for MM’s

**RevenueShareEscrow Inclusion:**  Fillers and market makers must include the user’s `RevenueShareEscrow` account in every order fill transaction. This PDA is derived from the user’s pubkey (requires no additional RPC calls).

**Multi Builder Support:**  Users can approve multiple builders, so MM’s may see multiple builder accounts to sweep to during `SettlePnl`. The protocol will not throw if a specific builder is omitted, but all filled rewards must eventually be swept.

**Error Handling:**  If a required escrow account isn’t included, the program will throw. Therefore it's recommended to always include it.

**Potential optimization:**  MM’s can pre-compute user > escrow account mappings to optimize tx size and speed.

### FAQ

**Q: Can a user approve multiple builders?**  
A: Yes, users can have multiple builders in their `ApprovedBuildersMap`, each with a specified max fee. Orders can be routed through any approved builder.

**Q: How are builder fees capped?**  
A: A: The protocol enforces the user-approved max fee per builder. Attempts to go over will result in a transaction failure.

**Q: Do MM’s or fillers need to know the builder/referrer accounts for every order?**  
A: No, but including the `RevenueShareEscrow` is required to process reward accrual and settlement.
