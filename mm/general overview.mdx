# General overview
A market maker places orders on both sides of the market (bid and ask) to capture the spread and provide liquidity. This guide introduces a simple market maker bot for Drift that uses oracle-based limit orders to automatically adjust to market changes.

Oracle limit orders are a special type of limit order whose price is defined relative to an external price feed (oracle) instead of a fixed number. You specify an offset above or below the current oracle price.

For example, placing a long (buy) oracle limit order on SOL-PERP with an offset of -1.0 means you want to buy at $1 below the current SOL oracle price. if the oracle is $100, your bid is $99; if the oracle moves to $99, your bid becomes $98, and so onâ€‹.

This keeps your orders near the oracle's value of the asset, which we can assume to be a good representation of the true market price. In trading, oracle-pegged orders help ensure quotes remain favourable, even as on-chain prices fluctuate.

In Drift, market orders and limit orders behave differently. A market order executes immediately against the best available prices in the orderbook. This guarantees a fill but at whatever price is available. In contrast, a limit order is placed at a specific price and will only fill at that price or better.
For this market maker bot, we use limit orders for both bid and ask quotes.

Keep in mind, we use `OrderType.LIMIT` for all the bot's orders, with oraclePriceOffset flied. `OrderType.ORACLE` is not used in this context because that is used for oracle-triggered market orders, which work differently.
